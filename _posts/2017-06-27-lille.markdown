![clock tower for the centre of commerce in Lille](https://github.com/tombye/trexit/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/IMG-20170627-WA0003.jpg)

So our first stop is Lille. Apparently it comes from "l'île", french for "The island", which is weird because it's not an island.

While we're talking Lille facts, here are a few more:

- it's where the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine was discovered
- until recent times its main industries were mining and textile manufacture
- Lille is twinned with Leeds in the UK
- like the rest of France, Lille still has a C&A.

I thought it might be nice to sign off with the unofficial song of Lille, a lullaby called P'tit Quinquin:

"Sleep, my little child,
My little chick, my plump grape,
You will cause me grief
If you don't sleep until tomorrow."
