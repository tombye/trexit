Over the last few days we've been walking through the Scarpe-Escaut national park.

We've seen forests, farmland and surprisingly pleasing mining slag heaps that dot the landscape. It's amazing to see all the plants and trees growing out of these massive piles of rock.

And you get an excellent view from the top.

Along the way we also saw:

A mine-shaft winding tower.

An old tower which used to pump water out of the mines.

Loads of logs, piled to the side of the paths, some with their own QR codes.

A lovely man who ran a sandwich shop in the town of Beuvrages.

When we told him about our trip, he gave us water and snacks for free. What a gent.

We reckon we've walked about 40 miles so far - 10 by mistake. Oops.
