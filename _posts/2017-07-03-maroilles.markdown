Maroilles

Yesterday we walked around 20km from Frasnoy to Maroilles in the Avesnois natural regional park.

Our feet are sore so we're having a rest day in Maroilles, a town famous for its delicious cheese. Clever us.

We've been repeatedly calling Maroilles 'Cheesy Town', sung to the tune of ['Funky Town'](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tVlMFS8CB-k). No doubt this will continue to endear us to the locals until we leave.
