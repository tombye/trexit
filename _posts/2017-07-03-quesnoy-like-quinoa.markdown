On Saturday we walked from Valenciennes to Le Quesnoy.

We quickly realised that pronouncing Quesnoy was beyond our rusty french. 

The tourist information in Valenciennes said "Kays-noi" but nobody else we met afterwards did.

The Internet says it's "kay-nwah", a bit like quinoa and at least as difficult to say.

Anyway, we ended up staying north of Le Quesnoy in Frasnoy.

We fucked up saying that too.
