I know top 10 lists are a bit crap but I can't resist. Here are our top 5 (not 10 so maybe it's ok) pieces of equipment so far. 

## Dr Bronner's soap (baby unscented)

We've used Dr Bronner's soap a lot already - mainly for washing clothes and dishes. I've used the almond-scented one before but I reckon the baby one's better because you don't walk around smelling like a Bakewell tart after every clothes wash.

## Thermarest pillow

All the camping shop nerds told us the Thermarest compressible pillow was definitely the thing. It's filled with memory foam cutoffs, which expand when you unpack the pillow. It felt a bit flimsy in the shop but the ones we bought online have been excellent so far. The Thermarest mattresses are great too.

## MSR tent

Our beloved tent was a bit pricey but it's been excellent. Super-light, super-easy to put up, roomy and very handsome.

## Phones

We don't get charged for data roaming in the EU any more (for now) so we've used our phones for loads of stuff including:

* navigating using Google Maps and Galileo
* transferring money 
* booking campsites
* updating our blog
* staying in touch with people back home

We're completely dependent on them.

## Tom's Trangia stove

I've never seen Tom look at anyone or anything the way he looks at his Trangia stove.

Other excellent things include:

* Swiss Army knife
* Compeed blister plasters
* bite and sting cream
* tourist information maps
* hand sanitiser
