## Trélon to Chimay

We crossed the border from France to Belgium a couple of days ago while we were walking from Trélon (famous for its glass-making) to Chimay (famous for its Trappist beer).

## Crossing the border

The thing about crossing the border was that it wasn't really a thing. No checkpoint. Not even a sign saying we were leaving France or entering Belgium. We were a bit disappointed by the lack of ceremony but really struck by how:

* strict the English border is by comparison
* Europe feels like much more of a single unit when you don't make a big deal about moving between countries 

## Nismes

In other news, we're now in Nismes and it's delightful. After 2 big walks in a row, it's a lovely place to take a rest day and recover. 

There's an excellent park where you can play with kinetic water sculpture things.

And the hotel we're staying in is great too. The owner collects everything from tea strainers to toilet roll.

Nismes was only meant to be a stopover but it's turned out to be a surprise treat. That's been one of the great things about walking. A lot of the best stuff happens in between the places we plan to visit.
