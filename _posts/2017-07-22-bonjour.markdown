We've been repeatedly saying "bonjour" in our very advanced french to everyone we pass on our walks - even when we're tired and broken.

Here's what Tom saying "bonjour" looks like.

Here's what Roz saying "bonjour" looks like.

We tried to recreate what it might look like to see us both saying "bonjour" but it didn't go well.
