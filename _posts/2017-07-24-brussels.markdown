After around 3 weeks of walking about 350 kilometres, we decided it was time to take a holiday from our holiday so we went to see friends in Brussels for the weekend.

As soon as we were settled, the excellent Sam and Stu took us on "The Tour" and it didn't disappoint.

## The Tour

Manneken Pis

We had an excellent time in Brussels. I don't think our trip would have felt complete without visiting what's been the heart of Europe for so long. And with Stu and Sam to show us around, it felt like we got a real sense of what a brilliant city it is. A city that incited Tom to utter the immortal words, "Look at all the doilies!" Unmissable.

Next stop, Strasbourg.
