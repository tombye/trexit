We arrived in Germany yesterday after getting a train to Baden Baden (so good they named it twice) fromÂ Strasbourg.

To explain, the day before we got a train to Strasbourg to get us into the Alsace region and give us a place from which to enter Germany.

Here's Strasbourg. Nice isn't it?

We chose Baden Baden because we thought it would be a good starting place for walking the Black Forest.

Here's Baden Baden. Nice isn't it?

For what feels like the second phase of our trip, we're starting by following the Ortenauer wine route to get some experience of walking in the Black Forest and to get further south.

We're still getting used to Germany and all the things that go with starting in a new country. So far so good though. The food, the trails and the views have all been great.
