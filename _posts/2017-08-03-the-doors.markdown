So far, walking in Germany has involvedÂ  puzzling over a lot of doors. We've seen these mysterious equations on a lot of the doors we've passed:

After a bit of Googling, we found out it's part of a catholic tradition people have been following since the 1500s.

Kids dress up as one of the [Magi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Magi) (Casper, Melchior or Balthasar) and go door to door collecting for a good cause.

The letters are an abbreviation for the latin "Christus maisonem benedictat", which means "Christ blesses this house". The "20" and "17" are this year so the last 2 numbers change each time. After they've done their rounds, the kids get to write the equation on the door.

Here's some more we've seen along the way.
