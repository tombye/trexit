Today, with no planning or vague intention to do so, we saw two world's largest things.

Here's the world's largest cuckoo clock.

![Cuckoo clock the size of a house](https://github.com/tombye/trexit/raw/gh-pages/assets/images/worlds-largest-cuckoo-clock-and-tom.jpg)

It's part of a cuckoo clock museum, just outside the town of Triberg.

Here's the world's largest toilet.

It's part of the Duravit design centre in the town of Hornberg.

Two off the bucket list then.
