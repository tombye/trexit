We'd been aiming for Freiburg from the start of our adventures in the Black Forest so we'd piled a whole load of expectations on it before we got there. Luckily, it was brilliant.

Freiburg's a student town and you can see it everywhere you go. There's a very relaxed vibe, everyone cycles everywhere, and by early evening, people start gathering by the river to drink and chat.

It's also very pretty. There are lots of colourful buildings and old towers and churches to look at.

We loved our time in Freiburg.

We paddled in the river like locals.

We saw kids making the most of the streams that run through the centre of town.

Tom drank the local beer.

We admired the elaborate manhole covers.

We ate delicious pastry.

Tom momentarily looked like he was taking himself very seriously while attempting to adjust his specs.

And we were extremely flattered to see they'd prepared for our arrival by painting pictures of us all over town.

What a great place!
