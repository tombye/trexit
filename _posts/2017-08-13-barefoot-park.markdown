Today we walked from Bad Bellingen (sung to the tune of [Bad Medicine](https://youtu.be/eOUtsybozjg?t=46s)) to Efringen-Kirchen. 

On our way, we walked round the Bad Bellingen 'barfuß park'. Apparently, [Germany has a few barefoot parks](http://www.barfusspark.info/en/park.htm) but it's not alone. It looks like the UK is representing too with [one in Stoke-on-Trent](http://www.trentham.co.uk/trentham-gardens/western-pleasure-ground/barefoot-walk).

The idea of the parks is that you walk on loads of different surfaces to stimulate different areas of your feet. It's supposed to work a bit like reflexology.

It's also meant to be a good way to encourage people to get some exercise. 

The one in Bad Bellingen was free and looked like it was loads of fun so we left our boots behind and gave it a go.

It started off innocently enough.

But that was the calm before the storm. 

This one was very undignified. 

![a series of big wooden discs each sitting on a solitary red spring](https://github.com/tombye/trexit/raw/gh-pages/assets/images/five-wooden-discs-with-spring-supports.jpg)

All attempts to stay upright resulted in looking like a 90s raver being electrocuted.

This was sweet relief.

This was hard.

This was not fun. 

![a path made up of lots of pointy stones](https://github.com/tombye/trexit/raw/gh-pages/assets/images/path-of-pointy-stones.jpg)

But overall it was excellent. And nice to feel the ground while we were walking for a change. When it was over, it felt like our feet and bodies were much happier with us.

Such a good idea.
