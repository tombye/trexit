Last night we survived our first proper thunderstorm in the tent. 

Usefully, we'd gone down an internet hole a few weeks ago reading about how safe we'd be in our tent if a storm hit. 'Not very' was the resounding answer. We tried to use the [lightning safety tips](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/natural-disasters/lightning-safety-tips/) we'd learnt anyway. This involved:

- clutching a walking boot each for 2 hours in the misguided hope that the rubber soles would ground us 
- crouching in unsustainable positions in our attempts to stay low without having too much of our bodies touching the ground
- Roz muttering at least 3 full renditions of ['My Favourite Things'](http://youtu.be/0IagRZBvLtw)
- some terribly mis-timed farts that we'd mistakenly hoped the noise of the thunder would hide

Textbook.
