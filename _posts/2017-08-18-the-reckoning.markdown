The German for "the bill" is "die Rechnung". Unless you're me in which case it's a strange combination of vowels and consonants sounding vaguely like "dee reckoning".

After over two weeks of trying I'm giving up. My brain clearly thinks asking for the bill in Germany is a great time to talk about when I'll finally get to enact my revenge which, as you can imagine, is a bit awkward.

See for yourselves:
