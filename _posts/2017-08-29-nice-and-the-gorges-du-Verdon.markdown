The next stage of our trip will be walking the [Camino de Santiago](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago). But before all that starts, we're taking some time out to visit some friends in the south of France. 

First on the list is Siân who's living in Nice for the summer. (Clever Siân.)

## Nice

Siân lives close to the beach so we were in the sea less than an hour after we arrived.

Nice has a long pebble beach with showers at the back so you just need your swimming stuff, a towel and some flipflops. 

The water's warm and you can see the art-deco hotels along the front while you swim in the sea.

Later on, Siân took us on a tour of the city at night. Nice is beautiful in the daytime and it's lovely at night too.

These fountains, which light up in different colours, are excellent.

## Gorges du Verdon

While we were in the area, we decided to go on a camping trip to the [Gorges du Verdon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdon_Gorge) national park.

The River Verdon runs through mountains and turns into some beautiful lakes along the way. After reading this [article about wild swimming in France](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/gallery/2012/may/04/france-wild-swimming-lakes-rivers), we were determined to swim in the lakes.

### Castellane 

We stayed in a campsite in a little town called Castellane.

### Lac de Castillon

Our first lake was Lac de Castillon just north of Castellane.

We spotted a beach full of people when we were driving alongside the lake. A quick u-turn later and we were there.

The water was colder than the sea but not too bad and so clear we could see our feet when we were wading in.

It was pretty definitely one of the highlights of our trip so far.

### Lac de Sainte-Croix

The next day we took a longer trip west to the Lac de Sainte-Croix. 

We stopped at two beaches. The first one was as beautiful as the day before, but even quieter.

The next beach was where the river turns into a lake. It was packed with people on or in anything that floated, including pedalos, canoes and even inflatable sofas.

We had a great time swimming up the river and looking up at the mountains towering over us.

### Driving

To get to any part of the Verdon Gorge, you have to drive around lots of hills and mountains. This means a lot of time driving on narrow roads, with a tall rock face on one side and a sheer drop on the other.

It's really hard to drive, despite how easy Siân made it look, and another fun test of [Roz's vertigo](http://trexit.org.uk/jekyll/update/2017/08/25/walking-with-vertigo.html). But on the bright side, the views were amazing.

On the way back, we were extremely grateful to end up behind a coach with a trailer at the back. It looked like it belonged to a Czech cycling team.

It acted like a snowplough so any cars coming towards us had to either make room or wait for us to pass.

It was going so slowly and carefully, it felt like it was making the journey much safer for us. So much so that when it pulled over to let the cars behind it pass, we pulled over too. When it set off again, we cheerfully followed it like particularly guileless spies tailing a suspect.

## Gourdon

On the way back from the Gorges du Verdon, we stopped at a little town called Gourdon.

![Courtyard in Gourdon](https://github.com/tombye/trexit/raw/gh-pages/assets/images/courtyard-in-gourdon.jpg)

At over 1,000 metres up, Gourdon is really beautiful and it has some spectacular views.

![View over the rooftops of Gourdon, showing the mountains ahead and the valley below](https://github.com/tombye/trexit/raw/gh-pages/assets/images/rooftops-of-gourdon.jpg)

It's also just north of Grasse, the unofficial capital of the French perfume industry so it has lots of little shops selling all sorts of scents and soaps, like this donkey milk bar of soap. Ewww. (Not ewe.)
