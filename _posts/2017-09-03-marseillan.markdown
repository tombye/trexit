Our last stop before starting the [Camino de Santiago](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago) was Marseillan. We went to see our friends John and Fanny who live there. Here they are.

## Canal du Midi

We thought it might be nice to arrive on foot so we decided to walk from Agde train station along the Canal du Midi.

John's directions included an encouraging instruction to "walk under an underpass where it looks like you might get murdered". It did but we didn't.

It's not a long walk but we managed to double the distance by getting lost. Luckily, it's a pretty walk so there was plenty to keep us entertained.

## Marseillan

Marseillan is an excellent port town, close to Montpellier.

It's got a lovely church and pretty houses.

It's the home of [Noilly Prat](https://www.noillyprat.com/).

And Marseillan Plage has an excellent roundabout, which has an artwork celebrating the traditional Marseillan game of Capèlet.

The men of Marseillan play Capèlet twice a year. They drunkenly compete to climb a greasy pole over the water and try to grab a stick with a bowler hat on it from the end. We saw it a couple of years ago. See?

## Driving to St-Jean-Pied-de-Port

John and Fanny are always brilliant hosts* but they were super-super kind this time. They housed and fed us, they let us ditch our big bags with them, and they even drove us to St-Jean-Pied-de-Port.

With their kids away, we got to listen to normally outlawed banging tunes.

And we arrived in St-Jean-Pied-de-Port with plenty of time to see the sights and eat Tapas together. Mmmm.

After all that, it was time to say goodbye and [prepare for the Camino](http://trexit.org.uk/jekyll/update/2017/09/03/preparing-for-the-camino.html).

*If you fancy staying in Marseillan, you should stay in [John and Fanny's flat](http://abnb.me/EVmg/9L9qatpI8F). They'll be nice to you even though you know us.
