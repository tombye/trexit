Our friend Fanny reckons we've done so much walking already, we'll be able to walk the Camino "avec les deux doigts dans le nez" (an excellent French saying). 

We're not so sure. Our first walk from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port to Roncesvalles is going to be 27 kilometres over a mountain. It sounds like a lot so we've decided to be as prepared as we possibly can be. 

Here's what we've done. 

## 1. Visited online Camino forums.

[Camino forums like this one](https://www.caminodesantiago.me/community/threads/st-jean-to-roncesvalles.20124/) are a great way to get an idea of what it might be like.

## 2. Bought a tiny book of Camino maps.

## 3. Brought smaller bags.

We swapped out our big, heavy bags for smaller ones that weigh half as much.

## 4. Visited the pilgrim's office.

The volunteers in the pilgrim's office provide route advice and give you a pilgrim passport with your very first stamp.

## 5. Bought walking poles.

Roz bought poles in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port to help with the steep climbs and descents.

This may make the whole 'fingers-in-the-nose' thing a bit tricky but you never know.
