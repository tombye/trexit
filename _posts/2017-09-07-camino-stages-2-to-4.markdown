We're a few more days into the Camino now and we've just finished stage 4.

Here are a few things we've seen along the way.

## Misty mornings

The walks start early so you're up with the sun. That means you sometimes get to see sights like this:

## The River Arga

Some of the towns we've passed throughÂ are on the river Arga. Here it is running through the town of Zubiri.

## Churches

Almost every town has a church and they're often very beautiful. Here are a couple of good ones.

## Handball

You see a lot of handball courts in this part of Spain. We were lucky enough to catch some kids being taught a few tricks.

## Sculpture of Camino pilgrims

An artist called Vincente Gabete did this sculpture of Camino pilgrims. It's on the top of a hill just west of Pamplona. It sits in the middle of a line of wind farms.

We couldn't resist ruining it for everyone else.

Idiots.
