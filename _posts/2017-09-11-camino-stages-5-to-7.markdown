Over the last 3 days, we've walked just over 70 kilometres from Puenta la Reina to Logroño. Yesterday's walk was 27.8 kilometres, which was our longest so far. We're sore but smug. 

The last few days have involved:

## Early starts

## Lovely views

## A wine fountain 

We stopped at what other hikers had been excitedly calling "the wall of wine". It turns out that - in the grand tradition of pisshead monks - the Irache Monastery has an actual wine fountain that Camino pilgrims can drink from. There's a water fountain too but no-one was very interested in that.

![The sign above the fountain](https://github.com/tombye/trexit/raw/gh-pages/assets/images/sign-above-the-fountain-of-wine.jpg)

The sign reads something like: "Pilgrim, if you want to get to Santiago full of strength and vitality, drink this great wine and make a toast to happiness."

## An accidental bull run in Viana

It's hard to describe the speed with which we transitioned from knackered to eyes-wide-open alarm when we reached a town at the top of the hill only to be told that the bull running was about to start. Despite our abject terror and concern for the frightened bulls, we stayed long enough to see a bit of the action. The best bit was the people-watching rather than the bull-running though.

## Nuts

A couple of days ago Tom got hit on the head by something falling from a tree. It looked a bit like a green fig but it wasn't as heavy. City kids that we are, it took us a few conversations with other people to discover that it was an almond.

We made a few laboured jokes about Tom not knowing an almond if it hit him on the head and resolved to eat the next one we saw.

Here's Tom cracking his nuts!
