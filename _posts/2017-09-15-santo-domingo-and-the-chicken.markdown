A few days ago, we were in a town called Santo Domingo de la Calzada. While we were there, our new friend Mary told us the story of Santo Domingo.

Santo Domingo is the patron saint of Spanish Civil Engineers. He's pictured here with a chicken.

Here's why they're hanging out together.

## The legend of the rooster and the chicken

The story goes that a pilgrim was travelling the Camino with his family. They were staying in a hostel when a Spanish girl tried to seduce him. He wasn't up for it so, as women often do, she decided to frame him for a serious crime. She put a silver cup in his bag and told everyone he stole it.

He was found guilty and hung. Thinking he was dead, his parents ploughed on to Santiago (maybe they only had a limited number of days off work for their trip). On their way back, they checked the body and realised he wasn't dead. He said Santo Domingo had saved him.

His parents went and told the magistrate who was eating a chicken and rooster. He didn't believe them and saidÂ their son was as dead as his dinner. At that point, both birds came back to life and flew off. This convinced the magistrate they were telling the truth so he ran off to untie their son (hooray).

A full version of the legend is on [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_de_la_Calzada).

## Chickens everywhere 

Pretty much everywhere we've seen Santo Domingo, we've seen a chicken.

## Amazing pastries

If you go to Santo Domingo de la Calzada, you see things related to the chicken story everywhere. The best are these excellent, and very tasty, pastries.
