## Super-early starts

We've been on some long, hot walks with lots of people competing for the same accommodation over the last few days so we've been getting up even earlier than normal. See?

On the bright side...

## Views

We've continued to see some delightful sights.

## Creative signposting

People have gone to all kinds of lengths to point us in the right direction.

## Sweet relief

We've been to lots of places with rivers. Almost every time we see one, we go for a soothing paddle.

## Food tips

We also had the good sense to befriend Leisa and Steve, an excellent couple from [Delaware](https://youtu.be/TK_FiRm6ZK8) who we met early on in the Camino. They're a few stages ahead of us now and they've been emailing us restaurant tips in all the places we're going to next.

Lovely them. Clever us.
