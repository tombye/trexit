Before we started the Camino, we always packed some food before each walk so we wouldn't starve. The emphasis was always on weight rather than nutrition. That meant we ate a lot of trail mix, dried bananas, Pringles and Mentos. 

Since we've started the Camino, lunch is easier because there's normally at least one cafe on the way. More smug-inducingly, there are often snacks we can grab off nearby bushes and trees too. 

Among other things, we've seen:

Massive mushrooms

Blackberries

Grapes (but we didn't pick them)

Almonds

Mint (from this excellent man's garden)

Sunflower seeds

You could probably make a fucked-up salad with all that. We haven't bothered, though.
