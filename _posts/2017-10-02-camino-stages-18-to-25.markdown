We've seen the landscape change quite a bit over the last week. Now we've left the [Meseta](http://trexit.org.uk/jekyll/update/2017/09/24/camino-stages-12-to-18.html#the-meseta), we've started to see more green and more hills. We've also seen some beautiful towns and cities. 

## León

After 3 weeks of walking without a break, we were starting to get a bit jaded so we decided to take a day off. 

Luckily, León is the perfect place for a rest day. There's lots to see and do.

Here's Tom pretending not to be impressed by the pretty streets.

Here we both are looking extremely pleased not to be walking.

And here's León Cathedral.

### León Cathedral

León Cathedral is best known for its stained-glass windows. They're everywhere.

You're encouraged to visit at certain times of the day to see how the difference in light changes your experience. We couldn't be arsed though.

Fully rested, our next big stop was Astorga.

## Astorga

Astorga is another beautiful city which, like León, would be a great place to visit outside the Camino.

Its claims to fame are its cathedral, the Episcopal Palace and its chocolate.

### The Episcopal Palace

The Episcopal Palace was one of only a few commissions [the architect Gaudi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoni_Gaudí) took outside of Barcelona.

It looks like a Disney castle from the outside but the inside is more of a showcase of Gaudi's work.

We really enjoyed:

The window seats that feel like they were made for having a chat.

The ceilings with their beautiful patterns.

The main chapel and its stained-glass windows.

The palace is now a museum dedicated to the Camino de Santiago. It has some excellent Camino-related artworks and artefacts.

### Astorga Cathedral

After walking 31 kilometres, we arrived a bit too late to go in the cathedral but we did manage to take these photos of the outside.

### Chocolate in Astorga

Astorga was one of the first places in Europe to produce chocolate. It has a [chocolate museum](http://www.aytoastorga.es/turismo-y-ocio/MUCHA/index.html) to tell the story and let you sample the product.

You can read more about [the history of chocolate in Astorga](http://astorga.co/en/astorga-chocolate/) if you're curious.

We didn't have time to go to the museum but Tom had churros for breakfast. He was very pleased.

Here are some other photos of excellent things we saw in Astorga.

## The iron cross

One of the best known parts of the Camino de Santiago is the iron cross. Here's Tom standing next to it.

![Tom standing next to the iron cross](https://github.com/tombye/trexit/raw/gh-pages/assets/images/tom-with-iron-cross.jpg)

### The cross

The iron cross is what it sounds like but it's mounted on a wooden pole at the top of a mountain between Foncebadón and Manjarin.

At its foot is a pile of stones. Pilgrims are meant to bring a stone from their home town and leave it at the cross to symbolise their journey. Stones are also left by pilgrims as a symbol of burdens they feel they've been carrying that they want to leave behind.

Whatever our thoughts on the cross, it was hard not to be moved by what the different stones meant to so many different people. Well, it was hard until a dude with a drone turned up.

### The summit 

The cross is on top of the highest mountain on this Camino route, over 1,500 metres up.

That meant we were in the clouds again.

### The descent

It also meant we spent the second half of the day coming back down to a normal height.

It didn't feel too bad at the time, but we were a bit sore for a few days afterwards. 

## Autumn is coming

It may be 31 degrees out but Autumn is definitely on its way. Weird.
