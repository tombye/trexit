Since our last post, we've climbed and descended another mountain, crossed into Galicia and visited a monastery.

## More mountains

Here are some views from the top of a mountain.

We walked along the top for a while with valleys on either side. We were so high we were above the clouds (again).

Here's the marker that told us we were in Galicia.

And here's a funny round house we saw in O'Cebreiro.

## The monastery of San Xulián de Samos

Next stop was a town called Samos, home to [the monastery of San Xulián de Samos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery_of_San_Xulián_de_Samos).

Its been around since the 6th century and it's a big draw for tourists as well as pilgrims.

Apparently it has the biggest cloister in Spain.

It also has a mural which Tom quite liked.

## Sarria

The officials at Santiago will only agree you've completed the Camino if you can prove you've done the last 100 kilometres. They're not too fussed if you've done the other 680 kilometres so lots of people only walk the last bit.

There's a town called Sarria about 100 kilometres away from Santiago so it's a popular starting point for anyone who doesn't want to walk the full distance.

For anyone walking the whole thing, Sarria's a reminder of how far they've come and that they're on the last stretch.

Here's one of the town's many churches.

## Terrible tan lines

It's still really warm and sunny, which means we've had plenty of time to cultivate some terrible tan lines while we're walking.

Here are Roz's.

Ridiculous.
