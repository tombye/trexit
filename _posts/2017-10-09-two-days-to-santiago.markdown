## Cold morning

When we set off this morning, we got a bit of a surprise. It was cold. So cold that we could see our breath in front of us. Here's a helpful demonstration:

It warmed up soon enough, though. Phew.

## Eucalyptus and oak trees

We walked through forests of eucalyptus, pine and oak trees for a lot of the day.

They smelt and looked amazing.

Tom said it was like walking past Lush. City kid.

## Not long now

We're walking to Santiago tomorrow. If we make it, we'll have managed it in 36 days. We'll see.

1 day to Santiago...
