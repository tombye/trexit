We really enjoyed walking through Portugal to Porto. We passed through vineyards, forests and some lovely towns and villages.

## Cobbled paths

Some of our first few walks in Portugal were on dirt paths through forests. But most of the paths we followed were like roman roads made from cubes of stone.

That meant walking was a bit rough on our feet.

## Second breakfast

On the bright side, at about 11am on most days, we somehow ended up near a pasteleria (not hard in Portugal where there's one on every corner).

That meant we often treated ourselves to a [second breakfast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_breakfast) - a concept we've now fully embraced. No trip to Portugal is complete without pasteis de nata so we've been bravely eating them whenever we've seen them.

## Santo Domingo at it again

We really enjoyed staying in Barcelos - a lovely town north of Porto. It turns out, it also has a thing for Santo Domingo's chicken. The story of [the rooster of Barcelos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooster_of_Barcelos) was [very familiar](http://trexit.org.uk/jekyll/update/2017/09/15/santo-domingo-and-the-chicken.html).

## Churches

Every town has a church and almost all of them look like this.

Except, because this is Portugal, there are a few with lovely tiles.

## Tiles

In Portugal, if there's a surface that can be tiled, it is tiled.

There are some excellent mosaics too.

## Boardwalk

Our last walk in Portugal was from Vila do Conde to Porto. We took the coastal path, which is almost all a boardwalk that stretches to Porto and beyond.

The weather was a bit grim but we were so pleased to see the sea, we didn't mind.
