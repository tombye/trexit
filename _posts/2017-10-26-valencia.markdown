We went to Valencia to have another small holiday from our holiday. It turned out to be an excellent choice. Valencia is pretty mega.

## Rerouted river

[In 1957, the River Turia flooded the city](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1957_Valencia_flood) and killed over 80 people. After the disaster, the government rerouted the river and replaced it with gardens, walking and cycling paths, and fountains.

## City of Arts and Sciences

[The City of Arts and Sciences](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Arts_and_Sciences) was also built on the old riverbed. It's a bonkers thing to walk around. It's like living in the future.

## Street art

We also stumbled across a lot of street art while we were wandering around the city.

## More top tiles

We saw some good tiles again.

## And lots more

And if all that wasn't enough, Valencia's got a lovely beach and excellent traffic lights.
