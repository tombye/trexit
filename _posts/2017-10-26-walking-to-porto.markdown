We were a bit blown away by Porto (also known as Oporto). It's ace. Neither of us had ever been before (although Roz's mum went when she was pregnant with Roz but we don't think that counts).

It reminded us of a kind of Portuguese cross between Copenhagen, Edinburgh and Brighton but that might just be because the weather was a bit shit.

## What's in a name?

Apparently Porto is sometimes called Oporto in English because of a [language misunderstanding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto). In Portuguese, Porto was sometimes referred to with a definite article, eg "o Porto". In English, that means "the port". English people heard it as "Oporto" and didn't bother to check if it was right or not. Idiots. 

## On the river

One of the prettiest areas of Porto is Cais de Ribeira. It's on the River Douro and it's beautiful.

## Port? Oh!

In case you didn't know Porto is famous for its port wine. Here's a fancy port cocktail it took us about 2 hours to drink:

## More tiles

We saw lots more good tiles in Porto.

Even the station was tiled.

And we saw a good cat mural.

## Lisbon

We only spent a few hours in Lisbon before we got the sleeper train back to Spain. It was as lovely as ever though.
