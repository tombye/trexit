In an almost-homage to Susan Vega, we recently stayed in [Lucca (on the second floor)](http://youtu.be/VZt7J0iaUD0?t=26s). Lucca was a delight and we're already planning a return trip.

## Wonderwalls

Lucca's old town is surrounded by massiveÂ walls.

We walked along the top of them.

It was a great way to get a feel for the place.

When we were done, we explored the rest of the town.

So pretty.

We also saw this amazing, cardboard monkey sculpture from an old arts festival.

## Comic festival

There was a lot of excitement while we were there because everyone was getting ready to stage 'Lucca Comics', Europe's biggest comic festival. It's not like 'ComicCon' in London where a bit of Docklands gets cordoned off. In Lucca, the whole town gets involved. Almost every shop we passed had something comic-related going on.

We also saw a lonely pikachu.

Luckily, someone in an inflatable sumo wrestler costume joined him shortly after this picture was taken. Phew.

## Via Francigena

Lucca is on the Via Francigena, another pilgrimage route, which goes from Canterbury to Rome. We went to the Via Francigena museum, where they projected the story of the pilgrimage on to the inside of the city walls. It was pretty cool.

## Cheese throwing

Aside from comics, pilgrimages and the local specialty of 'tordelli lucchesi' (meat ravioli in a meat sauce), Lucca is also famous for the game of 'tiro della forma' in which competitors throw whole cheeses using ropes. It must be pretty ropey cheese if they're throwing it away. Oof. [Sorry](https://youtu.be/fRh_vgS2dFE?t=1m21s).
