Old-school shutters are very popular in mainland Europe. While everyone else clearly loves them, they baffled us for at least the first month and a half of our trip. 

In our defence, we don’t really do shutters in the UK because the weather’s almost always shit.

Anyway, it took a kind cleaner to finally show us how to use them properly.

Opening them was easy enough. See?

But closing them was less obvious. We got there in the end though. Look how happy Tom is about it.

So, if you’ve been struggling with shutters like us, this blog post could save you from curtain death.
