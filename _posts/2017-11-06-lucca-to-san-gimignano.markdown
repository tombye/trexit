We spent the first few days of the Via Francigena walking from Lucca to San Gimignano and it was great. 

Our first day walking to Altopascio was super-sunny.

And we arrived just in time to see the aftermath of Halloween.

The next couple of days were less sunny but we still got to see some good churches and some excellent autumn colours.

We also got to sign the carefully-stored ‘Book of Francigena’.

When we arrived in San Gimignano, we found out there were going to be thunderstorms the next day so we decided to wait them out. There are definitely worse places to be stuck:
