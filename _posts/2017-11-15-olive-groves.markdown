We’ve seen a lot of olive groves since we’ve been walking in Italy.

So many that we started to imagine an Italian version of [Byker Grove](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byker_Grove) called Olive Grove. We got as far as Gianni [being blinded in a terrible olive-picking accident](http://youtu.be/oXeMontXSTI) and then we thankfully ran out of ideas. 

Moving on, it’s olive-picking season at the moment so we’ve learnt a bit about the olive-harvesting process over the last few days. We think it goes a bit like this:

## 1. Lay out a sheet under the trees.

We saw big sheets of netting under trees to catch as many olives as possible.

## 2. Cut off the branches.

The pickers we saw were using a tool called an oliviera. It has tongs which spin around to cut the olives from the tree.

## 3. Separate the olives from the branches.

We saw these 2 excellent dudes near Lake Bolsena:

![Two olive pickers posing with crates of olives and a machine which separates the olives from any bits of tree](https://github.com/tombye/trexit/raw/gh-pages/assets/images/olive-pickers.jpg)

They were using this machine to separate the olives from the branches. They put everything in the top bit then olives came out of the top chute and branches came out of the bottom chute.

Clever eh?  

## And that's not all...

It turns out people do olive farming in lots of different ways. If you're interested, why not read these articles we found on the subject:

- [Wikipedia page about olives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive)
- [a collection of articles on olive cultivation by an olive farmer](http://www.mediterraneangardensociety.org/olives.html)

Go on... olive a little!
