When we got to Siena, we were about halfway through our walk to Rome.

We stayed for two nights because:

- it's such a beautiful city
- Tom needed to see a dentist

Here's what we saw when we arrived:

## Almost mist it

On our first morning there, we woke up to find lots of mist and low cloud covering the city.

Undeterred, we went to the main sights and took pictures. Luckily, it cleared up soon afterwards so we can show a before and after for each landmark. 

### Palazzo del Pubblico

## Siena Cathedral 

Most of Siena Cathedral (also known as Duomo di Siena) is built with alternating layers of black and white marble. Black and white are Siena's colours so the cathedral designers were clearly briefed to go all in.

This makes it very stripey which Roz **really likes**.

## Siena in the sun

After the sun had decided it was here to stay, we took a few other pictures of the city.

## Tom's tooth

Most of our ailments on this trip have been foot-related so it was a surprise that Tom's mouth was the first thing to need serious medical attention. After about a week of increasingly unmanageable pain, we decided that Siena was the place to attempt to fix it.

Some calling around by our hotel's receptionist found a good dentist. Tom popped down and two hours of bad Italian (from Tom) and good dental work (from them) later he had a new crown. 

This anecdote probably won't form the basis of series 3 of The Crown on Netflix but you never know.
