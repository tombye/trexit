As of today, we’ve walked about 2,000 kilometres. To celebrate, we thought we’d try and summarise our trip in numbers. (That’s a bit of a crap celebration so we’ll probably drink some wine later too.)

## 99 walks

Altogether, we’ve been on 99 ‘proper walks’ - that means walking from one night’s accommodation to the next. 

## 32 kilometres in a day

We think the furthest we’ve walked in a day is 32 kilometres. We’ve only been over 30 a few times. Anything more than 25 tends to be a pain in the arse. But our hardest walk was 17 so you never know. It’s all about having:

- regular rest stops (preferably with loos)
- easy access to snacks
- interesting stuff to look at
- not terrible weather 

## 20 kilometres a day

Overall, we average about 20 kilometres a day. We started slowly because we were carrying more stuff, like our tent. With lighter bags, we average about 24 kilometres a day. Well done us.

## 7 countries

We’ve been to 7 countries:

- France
- Belgium
- Germany
- Switzerland
- Spain
- Portugal
- Italy

## 5 broken things 

We’ve broken 5 things:

- Tom’s tooth
- Roz’s toenail (ewww)
- [Tom’s boots](http://trexit.org.uk/jekyll/update/2017/07/24/broken-boots.html)
- Roz’s rucksack
- all of our sporks

## 4 sore feet

We’ve been having the best time but our feet haven’t. This is how they’re celebrating their 2,000th kilometre walked:
