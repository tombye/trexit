A train, a boat, a bus and another train later, we made it from Rome to Athens.

We saw loads of brilliant stuff in Athens and most of it was at a reduced price because we were there out of season. Clever us. 

## Panathenaic Stadium

On our first full day in Athens, we went to the home of the first modern olympics, the [Panathenaic Stadium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panathenaic_Stadium). Roz is obsessed with the Olympics so she got a bit overexcited.

![Roz on the top of the winners podium with arms aloft](https://github.com/tombye/trexit/raw/gh-pages/assets/images/roz-on-the-olympic-podium.jpg)

The whole stadium is made of marble and it’s got some neat features, like these thrones:

And this clever drainage system for when it rains:

It was also the first stadium to have curved seating at the corners so everyone got a good view. Not bad for something that was built 2,000 years ago.

## Acropolis

[The Acropolis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_of_Athens) is basically a bunch of very old buildings, including the Parthenon, which sit on a rocky hill that towers over Athens.

It’s amazing to walk around and imagine what life might have been like when it was first built. (Answer: Great if you were a man from Athens but shit if you were a woman, a slave or a foreigner.)

## Temple of Olympian Zeus

We also saw the [Temple of Olympian Zeus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Olympian_Zeus,_Athens), which helped us understand how columns work.

Clever eh?

## Excellent museums

We went to some excellent museums, including the [Museum of Cycladic Art](https://www.cycladic.gr/) and the [Acropolis Museum](http://www.theacropolismuseum.gr/en).

They gave us a really good idea of how sophisticated Ancient Greek society was. 

The Museum of Cycladic Art has some great examples of ancient art from the Cyclades islands. They’re super-simple and were the inspiration for modern sculptors like Barbera Hepworth and Henry Moore. 

![Head of a sculpture from ancient Greece with a featureless face and triangular nose](https://github.com/tombye/trexit/raw/gh-pages/assets/images/face-from-ancient-greek-sculpture.jpg)

And the Acropolis Museum helps explain how democracy in Athens - the first documented democracy anywhere - worked. It’s also got some great sculptures from around the Acropolis. All that’s missing are the Elgin Marbles, which the [British Museum makes an unconvincing case for keeping on its website](http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/news_and_press/statements/parthenon_sculptures.aspx).

## Great views

Whenever we did even the smallest amount of climbing in Athens, we were always rewarded with amazing views of the city:

The views were so good that we came away with our best selfie yet:

![Tom and Roz trying a selfie with Tom's face all screwed up from the sun](https://github.com/tombye/trexit/raw/gh-pages/assets/images/tom-and-roz-failed-selfie.jpg)

A triumph.
