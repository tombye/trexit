After doing a lot of walking from a to b, we're trying something a bit different now. We're doing circular walks on some of the Greek islands. 

Our first island was Andros, which is a few hours south-east of Athens.

## Good paths

Andros has a network of beautiful walking paths that are well-kept and have good markers.

They're a bit like the coastal paths in Cornwall. There's lots of climbing and descending with lovely beaches and stunning views.

## Pretty buildings

We stayed in a town called Chora on the east of the island. There are lots of lovely little pathways that wind in between the beautiful houses.

## Skimming

The local beach was covered in perfect stones for skimming:

Tom was very pleased with his throwing skills:

## Swimming

We even managed to swim. The water was a bit cold but it was super clean and clear. Here's Tom trying it out for the first time.

Yikes.
