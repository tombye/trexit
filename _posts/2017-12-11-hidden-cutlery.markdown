We've noticed an odd thing that happens whenever we eat out in Greece.

The cutlery is always hidden. Sometimes it's under the bread. Sometimes it'sÂ  covered in napkins. Wherever it is, it's always out of sight.

We can't figure out what's so embarrassing about visible cutlery. It's definitely a thing though. Weird.
