We've done a bit more island hopping since we left [Andros](http://trexit.org.uk/jekyll/update/2017/12/05/andros.html).

We've been to Tinos, Syros and Naxos. We were only on Syros for a few hours so this post is about what we saw on the other two islands.

## Tinos

### Our Lady of Tinos

When we got to Tinos, we were told one of the main reasons people visit is to see Our Lady of Tinos, a church in Tinos Town.

Apparently, it's a destination for pilgrims visiting an [icon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon) called "The Icon of the Annunciation". There's a red carpet on the road leading up to the church so we decided it must be pretty fancy even though we didn't see it.

The church is a beautiful building and has a lovely patterned floor outside the entrance made of tons of pebbles.

### Stepped fields

Most of the fields on Tinos are on the side of fairly steep hills. Each field has been made into steps of flat ground so people don't have to struggle their way up the slopes all the time.

Apart from being pretty, it's very handy for walkers like us.

### Tinos Town

Tinos Town (also known as Chora) is the main port for the island and where we stayed. With ferries banished around the corner, the harbour's delightful.Â  It's got amazingly clear, blue water, dotted with small local boats.

## Naxos

### Beautiful beaches

Naxos is another lovely island with some beautiful beaches that are perfect for long walks.

### Temple of Apollo

One of the main Naxos landmarks is the marble doorway you see when you get to the port.

![Marble doorway in the Temple of Apollo](https://github.com/tombye/trexit/raw/gh-pages/assets/images/marble-doorway-from-temple-of-apollo-in-naxos.jpg)

It's part of a temple to the god Apollo from 530 BC. It was started by [Lygdamis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lygdamis_of_Naxos), who ruled Naxos then, but it was never completed.

### Cycladic art

Naxos also has an excellent Museum of Archaeology. It has a lot of the kind of figures and pots we saw in [The Museum of Cycladic Art](http://trexit.org.uk/jekyll/update/2017/12/02/athens.html) in Athens.

The difference is how much more power they have when you see them in the same place where they were found.

The staff said there were plans to split the current site into three different museums. This would give them the space and facilities to show the whole collection properly. We thought it was great already and it only cost a euro to get in.

Bargain.
