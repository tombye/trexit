{{ site.description }}

From June to December 2017, we walked over 2,200 kilometres through [8 countries](http://trexit.org.uk/countries/). We:

- discovered some [brilliant walking routes](http://trexit.org.uk/routes/)
- tried our best to [speak like locals](http://trexit.org.uk/language-and-pronunciation/)
- made some [terrible jokes](http://trexit.org.uk/bad-jokes/)
- [learned a few lessons](http://trexit.org.uk/lessons-learned/) along the way
